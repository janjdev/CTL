# FLASK APP

This is the initial setup for the Flask app. I've used postgreSQL (another sql database) in lieu of sqlite as it offers better efficiency and functionality. This can be changed easily if needed.

## Quick SET UP

#### Clone the Repo From GitLab
1. Go to the [repo](https://comp.umsl.edu/gitlab/ctl/CTL)
2. Click "clone" and select the method easiest for you (typically Clone with HTTPS) 
3. I strongly recommend using VSCode as your IDE of choice. In VSCode (or whatever editor you're using) <br>
be sure to select ".venv:venv" as your choosen Python Interpreter.
Windows: ctl+shift+p -> Select Python Interpreter
Mac: cmd+shift+p ...
